# Workday-planner 
The user has a busy day and has a tough time keeping track of his/her tasks and/or events. In order to help them, the workday planner application was developed so that the user can jot down tasks that 
need to be done during a specific time. That time will be blocked for that task or event. The user can add save or delete the events.
